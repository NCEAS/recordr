#Overview

The *recordr* package collects information about R script executions (aka runs). The captured information 
includes the files that were read and written when R script execute, and details of the execution
environment, such as the operating system version, R packages loaded, etc.

The recorded information for a script constitutes data provenance for the data products and analysis
outputs (graphs, .csv files, etc) generated by a script execution, and provides information to describe how a data product was created.

#Using recordr
### Recording a Script Execution
The *record()* method that takes an R script as an argument and sources it.

The following example runs a sample script that is included with the *recordr* package:

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
library(recordr)
rc <- new("Recordr")
runid <- record(rc, system.file("extdata/EmCoverage.R", package="recordr") , tag="first recordr run")
```
It is not necessary to modify an R script in order to use *record*. The *record()* method
sources the specified R script and collects information for the R functions that 
are registered with it.

Information about the script execution is stored in the *recordr* cache directory and can be searched and viewed,  then individual runs can be uploaded to a  data repository.

### Listing Script Executions
Script runs that have been recorded can be listed using the *listRuns()* method. The
listing can be filtered by the tag value given to the run, the run start time, run end time, the text of error messages for a run and by a sequence number, which is an integer
value assigned to each run to assist in easily specifying a particular run for listing, 
viewing or publishing.

In this example, all runs with a tag containing the string "first" are listed. Because
recordr has only run once in this demo, only one run is listed:
```{r,warning=F,message=F}
library(recordr)
rc <- new("Recordr")
listRuns(rc, tag="first")
```
If no search parameters are specified to *listRuns*, then all recorded runs are listed. 

### Preparing Metdata for a Run

The first time that recordr() is run, an initial metadata template file is copied to 
the file "~/.record/package_metadata_template.R". Each time that record() is called, a
metdata file is created for the current run by using the template file as a starting
point and generating an EML document creating EML elements for the items in
the template file. In addtion an 'otherEntity' element is created for each each data
object that is created by the run.

The metadata template file can be edited before a run.

If you are using Rstudio, click on File->Open File (Ctrl-O)
and open ~/.recordr, then click on "package_metadata_template.R" in the File pane. 
Use Rstudio Ctrl-O to open the file.

Currently only the items that are in the template file can be updated, and new elements
cannot be added.

### Recording An R Console Sesion

*recordr* can also collect information during an R console session using the
startRecord() method to begin recording and endRecord() to stop information capture. 

```
rc <- new("Recordr")
startRecord(rc, tag="first console run")

df <- read.csv(file = system.file("./extdata/coverages_2001-2010.csv", package="recordr"))
endocladia_coverage <- df[df$final_classification=="endocladia muricata",]
myDir <- tempdir()
csvOutFile <- sprintf("%s/Endocladia_muricata.csv", myDir)
write.csv(endocladia_coverage, file = csvOutFile)

endRecord(rc)
```

The history of all statements typed during this recorded console session is
saved in the *recordr* cache and will be included in the datapackage uploaded 
to a data repository when publishRun() is called.

### Viewing Script Executions

More detailed information can be retrieved and viewed for a run or set of runs
using the *viewRuns()* method.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
library(recordr)
rc <- new("Recordr")
viewRuns(rc, tag="console run")
```
### Publishing
The *recordr* package uses the R package *dataone* to assist in packaging and publishing data generated by a script execution. 

The *dataone* package uses a configuration file to assist
in how various operations are performed such as publishing a data package when the
*publishRun()* method is called. 

The first time that *record()* is run, an initial copy of the *dataone* configuration parameter file is copied to the directory '~/.dataone/sessionConfig.R'. This file can
be edited before *publishRuns()* is called, for example, to control where the
package is published to.

Open the file ~/.dataone/sessionConfig.R and make the following changes:
- change the parameter dataone_env to "SANDBOX2"
- change the parameter target_member_node to "urn:node:mnDemo2"

```
library(recordr)
rc <- new("Recordr")
publishRun(rc)
`
```
myMeta <- getMetadata(rc, seq=2)
writeLines("/tmp/my.eml", myMeta)
```

### Editing Generated Metadata For a Run

```
putMetadata(rc, seq=1, "/tmp/my.eml", asText=F)
```
``

Next we need to tell *recordr()*
