## Overview

The *recordr* package collects information about R script executions (also refered to as "runs"). The recorded information
includes the files that were read and written by the R script, and details of the execution
environment, such as the operating system version, R packages loaded, etc.

The recorded information for a script constitutes data provenance for the data products and analysis outputs (graphs, .csv files, etc) generated by a script execution, by providing  information to describe how the data products were created.

## Using recordr
### Recording a Script Execution
The *record()* method takes an R script filename as an argument and sources it, recording files that
were read and written by R functions that are registered with *recordr*. It is not necessary to 
modify an R script in order to use *record*. 

The following example runs a sample script that is included with the *recordr* package:

```{r echo=F,warning=F,message=F,eval=F}
# For recordr package maintainer only
library(recordr)
rc <- new("Recordr")
deleteRuns(rc, seq=1:1000)
```

```{r record,warning=F,message=F}
library(recordr)
suppressWarnings(require(ggplot2))
rc <- new("Recordr")
sampleScript <- system.file("extdata/EmCoverage.R", package="recordr")
firstRunId <- record(rc, sampleScript , tag="first recordr run")
```

Information about the script execution is stored in the *recordr* cache (~/.recordr). *recordr* provides methods to
search and view items stored in the cache. It is not recommended that files or directories be manually edited or deleted from the cache directories, with the exception of the items mentioned in this document.

### Listing Script Executions
Script runs that have been recorded can be listed using the *listRuns()* method. The
listing can be filtered by the tag value specified when a run was recorded.
Runs can also be filtered by run start time, run end time, the text of error messages for a run and by a sequence number, which is an integer
value assigned to each run to assist in easily specifying a particular run for listing or viewing.

In this example, all runs with a tag containing the string "first" are listed. Because
recordr has only run once in this demo, only one run is listed:
```{r listRuns,warning=F,message=F}
listRuns(rc, tag="first")
```
If no search parameters are specified to *listRuns*, then all recorded runs are listed. 

### Preparing Metdata for a Run

The first time that recordr() is run, an initial metadata template file is copied to 
the file "~/.record/package_metadata_template.R". Each time that record() is called, a
metdata file is created for the current run by using the template file as a starting
point and generating an EML document, creating EML elements for the items in
the template file. In addition 'otherEntity' element is created for each each data
object that is created by the run and the R script that was run.

The metadata template file can be edited before a run, using the values you specify
to affect the generated EML document.

If you are using Rstudio, click on File->Open File (Ctrl-O)
and open ~/.recordr, then click on "package_metadata_template.R" in the File pane. 

Currently only the items that are in the template file can be updated, and new elements
cannot be added, so for example, the 'title', 'abstract' and 'creators' can be edited.

### Recording An R Console Session

*recordr* can also collect information during an R console session using the
*startRecord()* and *endRecord()* methods. When *startRecord()* is typed in
the R console, information capture begins. Information will be captured for any
function registered with *recordr*, while all other console input will not cause
any information capture. Information capture is terminated when *endRecord()* is
entered in the console, and execution information is written to the *recordr* 
cache.

```{r console session,warning=F,message=F,eval=F}
startRecord(rc, tag="first console run")

df <- read.csv(file = system.file("./extdata/coverages_2001-2010.csv", package="recordr"))
endocladia_coverage <- df[df$final_classification=="endocladia muricata",]
myDir <- tempdir()
csvOutFile <- sprintf("%s/Endocladia_muricata.csv", myDir)
write.csv(endocladia_coverage, file = csvOutFile)

endRecord(rc)
```

The history of all statements typed during this recorded console session is
saved in the *recordr* cache and will be included in the data package uploaded 
to a data repository when publishRun() is called.

### Viewing Script Executions

More detailed information can be retrieved and viewed for a run or set of runs
using the *viewRuns()* method, for example:

```{r viewRuns,warning=F,message=F,eval=T}
viewRuns(rc, id=firstRunId, sections=c("details", "used", "generated"))
```

Information for all matching runs is retrieved and displayed, 
The output displayed by *viewRuns* is divided into the sections "details", "used"
and "generated", which can be selectively displayed using the _sections_ parameter.

## Information Collected By The *recordr* package

The *record()* method will currently record information for the following methods:

package    | function
---------- | --------------
dataone    | getObject         
dataone    | create            
dataone    | updateObject      
utils      | read.csv          
utils      | write.csv         
ggplot2    | ggsave            
base       | readLines         
base       | writeLines        
png        | readPNG           
png        | writePNG          
base       | scan              

Other information about the execution environment is also recorded, such as the R packages that were
loaded, the operating system, system user name.

## *recordr* Internals

The following description is provided for informational purposes only and is not required to
use the *recordr* package.

The *recordr* package can record execution information for the commonly used R functions mentioned in the
previous section by using *wrapper* functions that are called before a requested function is called. This overriding 
of functions is only in effect when the *record()* function is running. This overridding is accomplished by 
temporarily adding an entry to the R search path so that the *recordr* wrapper functions are first in the
search path. For example, if a script that is run with the *record()* function calls the following function:

```{r, eval=F}
df <- read.csv(file = ("/usr/smith/data/coverages_2001-2010.csv", package="recordr"))
```

then the wrapper function *recordr_read.csv* is first called because *record()* has temporarily bound
*recordr_read.csv* to the function name *read.csv* in the temporary environment named ".recordr" that is
attached to the search path, so that the overridden function appears first in the search path, regardless
of package load order. The function *recordr_read.csv* records that the file 
`/usr/smith/data/coverages_2001-2010.csv` was read. Then this wrapper function searches for the next function 
`read.csv` in the search path, which is the function that would have been run if *record()* was not active.

When the script has completed, the *record()* function unattaches the ".recordr" environment from the
search path, thereby restoring the R search path to it's previous state, as it was before *record()* was
called.

Note that this mechanism that *record()* used to override functions doesn't work for function calls
that are fully qualified, i.e. the package name is included in the call. For example, the following
function call would not be recorded:

```{r, eval=F}
df <- utils::read.csv(file = ("/usr/smith/data/coverages_2001-2010.csv", package="recordr"))
```

Also, the *record()* function currently cannot record information for input or output files that are opened as a connection, for
example, the following call to `writeLines` would not be recorded:

```
  # Write out to a file using a connection
  sbuf <- paste(LETTERS, collapse="")
  tfile <- sprintf("%s/letters.dat", tempdir())
  fcon <- file(description=tfile, open="w")
  writeLines(sbuf, fcon)
  close(fcon)
```

This problem will be addressed in the next feature release of *recordr*.

```{r cleanup, echo=F,warning=F,message=F,eval=T}
# Remove the runs created by the examples.
rc <- new("Recordr")
deleteRuns(rc, id=firstRunId, quiet=T)
```
