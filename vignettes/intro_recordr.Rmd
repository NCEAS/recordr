#Overview

The *recordr* package collects information about R script executions (aka runs). The captured information
includes the files that were read and written by the R script, and details of the execution
environment, such as the operating system version, R packages loaded, etc.

The recorded information for a script constitutes data provenance for the data products and analysis outputs (graphs, .csv files, etc) generated by a script execution, by providing  information to describe how the data products were created.

#Using recordr
### Recording a Script Execution
The *record()* method takes an R script as an argument and sources it, recording files that
were read and written by R functions that are registered with *recordr*. It is not necessary to
modify an R script in order to use *record*.

The following example runs a sample script that is included with the *recordr* package:

```{r echo=F,warning=F,message=F,eval=F}
# For recordr package maintainer only
library(recordr)
rc <- new("Recordr")
deleteRuns(rc, seq=1:1000)
```

```{r record,warning=F,message=F}
library(recordr)
rc <- new("Recordr")
sampleScript <- system.file("extdata/EmCoverage.R", package="recordr")
runid <- record(rc, sampleScript , tag="first recordr run")
```

Information about the script execution is stored in the *recordr* cache (~/.recordr). *recordr* provides methods to
search, view, modify and publish items stored in the cache. It is not recommended that files or directories be manually edited or deleted from the cache directories, with the exception of the items mentioned in this document.

### Listing Script Executions
Script runs that have been recorded can be listed using the *listRuns()* method. The
listing can be filtered by the tag value specified when a run was recorded.
Runs can also be filtered by run start time, run end time, the text of error messages for a run and by a sequence number, which is an integer
value assigned to each run to assist in easily specifying a particular run for listing,
viewing or publishing.

In this example, all runs with a tag containing the string "first" are listed. Because
recordr has only run once in this demo, only one run is listed:
```{r listRuns,warning=F,message=F}
listRuns(rc, tag="first")
```
If no search parameters are specified to *listRuns*, then all recorded runs are listed.

### Preparing Metadata for a Run

The first time that recordr() is run, an initial metadata template file is copied to
the file "~/.record/package_metadata_template.R". Each time that record() is called, a
metadata file is created for the current run by using the template file as a starting
point and generating an EML document, creating EML elements for the items in
the template file. In addition 'otherEntity' element is created for each each data
object that is created by the run and the R script that was run.

The metadata template file can be edited before a run, using the values you specify
to affect the generated EML document.

If you are using RStudio, click on File->Open File (Ctrl-O)
and open ~/.recordr, then click on "package_metadata_template.R" in the File pane.

Currently only the items that are in the template file can be updated, and new elements
cannot be added, so for example, the 'title', 'abstract' and 'creators' can be edited.

### Recording An R Console Session

*recordr* can also collect information during an R console session using the
*startRecord()* and *endRecord()* methods. When *startRecord()* is typed in
the R console, information capture begins. Information will be captured for any
function registered with *recordr*, while all other console input will not cause
any information capture. Information capture is terminated when *endRecord()* is
entered in the console, and execution information is written to the *recordr*
cache.

```{r console session,warning=F,message=F,eval=F}
startRecord(rc, tag="first console run")

df <- read.csv(file = system.file("./extdata/coverages_2001-2010.csv", package="recordr"))
endocladia_coverage <- df[df$final_classification=="endocladia muricata",]
myDir <- tempdir()
csvOutFile <- sprintf("%s/Endocladia_muricata.csv", myDir)
write.csv(endocladia_coverage, file = csvOutFile)

endRecord(rc)
```

The history of all statements typed during this recorded console session is
saved in the *recordr* cache and will be included in the data package uploaded
to a data repository when publishRun() is called.

### Viewing Script Executions

More detailed information can be retrieved and viewed for a run or set of runs
using the *viewRuns()* method.

```{r viewRuns,warning=F,message=F}
viewRuns(rc, tag="console run", sections=c("details", "used", "generated"))
```

Information for all matching runs is retrieved and displayed,
The output displayed by *viewRuns* is divided into the sections "details", "used"
and "generated", which can be selectively displayed using the _sections_ parameter.
