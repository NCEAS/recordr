Authors@R: c( person("Peter", "Slaughter", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "slaughter@nceas.ucsb.edu"),

Description: The R package recordr provides methods to easily record data
    provenance about R script executions, such as the files that were read and
    written by the script, along with information about the execution, such as
    start time end time, the R modules loaded during the execution, etc. This
    provenance information along with any files created by the script can then
    be combined into a data package and uploaded to a data repository such as
    DataONE.
