Version: 0.9.0.9006
Authors@R: c( person("Peter", "Slaughter", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "slaughter@nceas.ucsb.edu"),
    person("Matthew", "Jones", email = "jones@nceas.ucsb.edu"),

Description: Provide methods to record data provenance about R script
    executions. Provenance data includes files that were read and written by
    the script, along with information about the execution, such as start time
    end time, the R modules loaded during the execution, etc. This provenance
    information along with any files created by the script can then be combined
    into a data package and published to a data repository such as DataONE <https://
    www.dataone.org>.
